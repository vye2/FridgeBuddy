# FridgeBuddy
FridgeBuddy is a mobile application that helps the user manage their refrigerator and pantry inventory. Users are able to quickly scan the barcodes of their groceries into the app and keep track of what food items are stored in their refrigerator for later use. Users are also able to generate recipes based on their currently stored food items, and prevent food waste by displaying what food items are near expiration.
